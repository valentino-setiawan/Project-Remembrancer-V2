    <h2>A little about us</h2>
    <section class="Desc1">
      <h4>Our Pledge</h4>
      <p>
        As part of the Independent and Tested Expeditionary Cinemagrophy mission
        (ITEC) it is our sworn obligation to document, identify and otherwise
        explain any anomalies assigned to us, mostly pertaining to The Tainted
        Inheritors designated as 10-PPLG-2.<br><br>
        *Clarification: 10 = corresponding to which wave caused emergence, PPLG =
        Procedure and Processing: Leave Guarded, 2 = number of wave's subset if
        present.

      <h4>Our Duty</h4>
      <p>
        To achieve our goals is to consider no task too difficult, no ends too
        loose and no action too unthinkable. Only the complete and whole research
        of Them shall sate us, from which it shall never come. It is for this
        reason we have spent our efforts sending scouting and probing operations
        to best study and identify Them.

      <h4>Our Lonesome Road</h4>
      <p>
      It is through and for all this that we have created this domain to act as
      the largest acting archive for material relevant to our goal. To act as a
      profile for our struggles and for future cross reference if necessary.
